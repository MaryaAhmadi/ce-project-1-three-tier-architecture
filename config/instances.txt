# EC2 Instances Overview - Project: 3-Tier Architecture
# =====================================================
# This file documents all EC2 instances used in the project.
# Includes instance IDs, private IPs, availability zones,
# subnet type, instance type, and purpose in the architecture.
# =====================================================

# -----------------------------
# Application Tier Instances
# -----------------------------

Instance Name: project-app-instance-1
Instance ID: i-0a79a0e12d80b1fc0
Private IP: 10.0.3.202
Availability Zone: us-east-1a
Subnet: private-app-subnet-1 (Private)
Instance Type: t3.micro
Purpose: Runs the web application; registered with the ALB target group; responds to /health endpoint.

Instance Name: project-app-instance-2
Instance ID: i-02f5a7adb1ba50dce
Private IP: 10.0.4.87
Availability Zone: us-east-1b
Subnet: private-app-subnet-2 (Private)
Instance Type: t3.micro
Purpose: Runs the web application; registered with the ALB target group; responds to /health endpoint.

Instance Name: project-app-instance-3
Instance ID: i-0d7a22a52a438b4b5
Private IP: 10.0.3.203
Availability Zone: us-east-1a
Subnet: private-app-subnet-1 (Private)
Instance Type: t3.micro
Purpose: Runs the web application; registered with the ALB target group; responds to /health endpoint.

# -----------------------------
# Database Tier Security Group
# -----------------------------
# While not an instance, the DB Security Group is documented here for completeness.

Security Group Name: project-sg-db
Security Group ID: sg-xxxxx
Purpose: Allows inbound MySQL/Aurora traffic from application tier instances only; ensures database isolation.

# =====================================================
# Notes:
# - All application instances are in private subnets and cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
# - Each instance reports its ID, AZ, and database connection status through the web application.
# - ALB distributes traffic evenly across these instances for high availability.
