# Demo Script

## Introduction
Today I will demonstrate a highly available three-tier architecture deployed on AWS.

## Demo Flow
1. Show VPC and subnet structure  
2. Show security groups  
3. Demonstrate ALB  
4. Show application response  
5. Demonstrate failover behavior  
6. Review cost analysis  

## Key Points to Emphasize
- High availability across two AZs  
- Proper network isolation  
- Principle of least privilege  
- Health check automation  

## Closing
This architecture provides a solid foundation for production workloads with room for future scaling.
